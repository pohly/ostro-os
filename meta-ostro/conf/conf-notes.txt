Common targets are:
    ostro-image-noswupd (when building without swupd,
                         the recommended mode for local image building)
    ostro-image-swupd-reference (when building with swupd)

We recommend to use VirtualBox if you wish to run an Ostro image in a
virtual environment. Please check the doc/howtos/booting-and-installation.rst
technical note for more information.
